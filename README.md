# manim_theoretical

Repository of Manim code to create animations for science presentations, theoretical physics oriented (you can find some of them in my [website](https://panopepino.github.io/web_page/))

This will be upgraded as I code material.

INFORMATION TO BE CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE UPDATES:

- There should be an init file at the level of custom_ani, etc. The folder that you install as a local package is src, and that needs an __init__ hook!
- The version of the package is updated with the setup file.

REQUIREMENTS:

- Python >= 3.7
- manim >= 0.17
- manim-slides >=4.14

TO DO:
- Add .svg files to the package to be installed.
- Create webpage with documentation. (At least I do not get lost when writing my own slides)
- Check if making vgroup elements as properties of the class is a faster method (as done with equations and value tracker)
- Improve expanding bubble animation for 3d case (strange issue with FadeIn and Out)

Important animation to be added (Research level):

- Bending brane + Strings
- Necesary ones that come with new research.

Important animation to be added (Popular science level):

- Four fundamental interactions
- Strings and particles
- Snake game from rectangle to torus
- Boiling water animation
- Nice explanation of inflation vs particle horizon. Causal contact etc.
